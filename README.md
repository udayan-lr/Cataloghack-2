Topic: Smart assessment board - School teacher is planning to conduct a quiz competition on identifying states and its capitals of our country. Hence, school teacher needs a model through which teacher conducts the competition easily. 

Approach used:
* Create a dictionary containing the 28 capital and state pairs as its values
* Ask the user 10 questions randomly out of the 28 pairs (Capital is displayed and corresponding state is asked, or vice versa)
* Once a question is asked on a pair of capital and state, the pair is removed from the dictionary to avoid repetition of questions
* Final score is displayed (out of 10)
